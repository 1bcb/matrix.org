A Dart implementation of the federated communications protocol, Matrix.

This SDK is for general use, but mainly being developed for [Pattle](https://pattle.im), an easy to use Matrix app.

## Usage
   
   ```dart
   import 'package:matrix_sdk/matrix_sdk.dart';
   import 'package:url/url.dart';

   void main() async {
     final sqfliteStore = SqfliteStore();
     final homeserver = Homeserver(Url.parse('https://pattle.im'));

     final user = await homeserver.login(Username('pat'), 'pattle', store: sqfliteStore);

     await for(SyncState syncState in user.sync()) {
       await for (final room in user.rooms.all()) {
         // Do something
       }
     }
   }
   ```
   This example uses the
   [`SqfliteStore`](https://git.pattle.im/pattle/library/matrix-dart-sdk-sqflite)
   , which is a seperate dependency and only works on Flutter.

   Note that using a store is optional.

   Also uses the [`url`](https://pub.dev/packages/url) package for `Url.parse(..)`.
