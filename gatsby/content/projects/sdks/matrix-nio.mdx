nio is a multilayered matrix client library. The underlying base layer doesn't
do any IO on its own. On top of the base layer, a no-IO HTTP client
implementation exists, as well as a full fledged batteries included asyncio
layer using [aiohttp](https://github.com/aio-libs/aiohttp/).

The full API documentation for nio can be found at
