RiotX is the next-generation Riot client for Android.

The RiotX beta app is available from the [Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=im.vector.riotx) and from [F-Droid](https://f-droid.org/packages/im.vector.riotx/).

You can also install the latest development version of RiotX from
[Buildkite](https://buildkite.com/matrix-dot-org/riotx-android). Use it at your own risk and only if you know what you are doing.
