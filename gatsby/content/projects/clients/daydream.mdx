Daydream is the Idea of a Matrix webclient purely written in Rust using Webassambly. It is written on top of [matrix-rust-sdk](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/).

You can use it at https://app.daydream.im/ and get the source from [GitHub](https://github.com/MTRNord/Daydream)!

This is currently on hold due to restrictions on the code side that are not solvable at this point.
