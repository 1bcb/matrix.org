SchildiChat for Android is a Matrix Client based on Element Android with a more traditional instant messaging experience. Currently, the app is not available on Google Play Store to avoid legal complications. The app is available on [F-droid](https://f-droid.org/de/packages/de.spiritcroc.riotx/). If you prefer the variant that features push notifications, you can get it from the [SpiritCroc F-Droid repository](https://schildi.chat/android/install-from-sc-fdroid). You can also check out the source code on [Github](https://github.com/SchildiChat/SchildiChat-android). Contributions are welcome.
