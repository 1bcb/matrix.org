This project bridges [Slack](https://slack.com) to Matrix.

The bridge allows you to connect Matrix rooms and Slack channels together. It supports bridging via webhooks or via a dedicated slack integration (using the Events API). Currently the bridge supports sending text and files, with more advanced features like threading and sending direct messages coming in the future. matrix-appservice-slack is regularly hacked on and is accepting PRs for bug fixes and new features.
