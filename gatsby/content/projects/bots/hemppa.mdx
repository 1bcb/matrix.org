This bot is meant to be super easy platform to write Matrix bot functionality
in Python. It uses matrix-nio library <https://github.com/poljar/matrix-nio/> for
Matrix communications.

Zero configuration except minimal Matrix account info is needed. Everything else can
be done with bot commands.

Type !help in room with this bot running to list active modules.

If you don't want some modules, just delete the files from modules directory.
