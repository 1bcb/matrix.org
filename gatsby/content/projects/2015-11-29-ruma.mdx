The Ruma Rust-language homeserver project is [currently not maintained](https://github.com/ruma/ruma), but the *Ruma project*,
including [ruma-api](https://github.com/ruma/ruma-api]) (framework for building Matrix APIs in Rust) and
[ruma-client-api](https://github.com/ruma/ruma-client-api) (request and response types for the Matrix client API)
are still being actively worked on.
