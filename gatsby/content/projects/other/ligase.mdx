Ligase is a Golang-based implementation of Matrix home server, following the Matrix spec as defined at matrix.org. It has been used in production by an array of financial institutions in various scenarios, including but not limited to OTC-style trading (i.e in the bond trading market), collaborative workspace, stock brokerage, retail banking and more. It usually serves as the core to support more sophisticated financial applications running in secured, on-premise and regulation-compliant environments. But nothing limits it as a powerful Instant Messaging server as well as a general purpose, open, Messsging As A Platform (MaaP) solution.
