#### What is the "System Alerts" room Riot shows me on new Matrix.org accounts?

'Server Notices' are a new feature introduced in Synapse 0.30. They provide a channel whereby server administrators can send messages to users on the server.

Read more about them in the [Synapse docs on Server Notices](https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/blob/master/docs/server_notices.md) and in the [Server Notices section of the Matrix Client-Server Spec](https://matrix.org/docs/spec/client_server/r0.5.0#id209).
