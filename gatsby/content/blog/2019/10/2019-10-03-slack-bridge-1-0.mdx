Hello Matrix enthusiasts! Today we released matrix-appservice-slack 1.0. This marks a major milestone
in bridge development for the Matrix.org team, being our first bridge to ever reach 1.0. The decision to
release this version came after we decided that the bridge had gained enough features and reached a point
of stability where it could be deployed in the wild with minimal risk.

For those not in the know, the Slack bridge is Node.JS based, and bridges slack channels & users into Matrix
seamlessly. In previous versions only a limited subset of features were supported, making heavy usage of Slackâ€™s
webhook API. As of 1.0, the bridge now makes use of the newer Slack Events/RTM API which gives us all we need for
a richer bridging experience. Everything from edits and reactions to typing notifications is supported in the 1.0 release.

Threading & Reactions!


The bridge has undergone some pretty serious code surgery as well. The whole codebase has been rewritten in
TypeScript to take advantage of type checking and generic types. The datastore interface now supports PostgreSQL,
which allows for administrators to inspect and edit the database while the bridge is running, as well as offering
a helpful performance boost over the NeDB datastore format that was used previously. Finally, the codebase has proper
Unit and Integration Tests to ensure new changes will not cause any regressions in behaviour.
In short, **now is an excellent time to get involved and hack on the bridge**.

In terms of how many users matrix.org is currently serving at the moment, we present to you some figures:
- 2562 bridged rooms
- 764 teams connected to the bridge
- 103711 events have passed through the bridge since the launch of 0.3.2

Of course, our work doesnâ€™t stop at 1.0. The plan for the immediate future of the bridge
is to continue adding support for other event types coming from Matrix and Slack to create
an ever richer experience. Obvious features are things like topic changes, and syncing membership
across the bridge. In the long term future we would also like to add community support to the bridge,
so whole Slack workspaces can be bridged across with a single click.

Thatâ€™s all from me, and I would like to say a massive thank you to Cadair and Ben for both their
code and review work on the project and as always, thank you to the community for using the bridge and reporting issues. ðŸ™‚
