## Matrix Live 🎙

## Dept of Spec 📜

## Dept of Ping 🏓

New!! A new section where we will reveal, rank, and applaud the homeservers with the lowest ping, as measured by [pingbot](https://github.com/maubot/echo), a [maubot](https://github.com/maubot/maubot) that you can host on your own server. Join [#ping:maunium.net](https://matrix.org/#/#ping:maunium.net) to experience the fun live, and to find out how to add YOUR server to the game.
