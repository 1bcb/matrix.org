[Google Summer of Code](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/) participants were announced last week. **[This year Matrix was assigned SIX students!](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/organizations/6060943798173696/)**

We recieved dozens of applications this year, which made narrowing our focus to six students difficult, but we are proud to announce:

**Devin Ragotzy**, who has been involved with the Ruma project in the past, will work on *Ruma procedural macro refactoring and more*

**Arnav Tiwari** will work with Travis and myself to create *HTML Embeddable Matrix Chat Rooms*

**Nikolaos Filippakis** will work to support *E2E encryption for go-neb*. Kegan, one of the original go-neb authors is particularly excited about this one

**Brooks Karlik** will update matrix-ircd: *Move matrix-ircd to async/await*. This will be a welcome upgrade for anyone using that project!

**Tyagdit** will work with Cadair and the [OpsDroid team](/blog/2020/05/01/this-week-in-matrix-2020-05-01) on *Enabling E2EE in Opsdroid Matrix Connector*

**Chethan Reddy**, last but not least, will work with Nico and the Nheko gang on *Adding Features in End-to-End encryption for Nheko-Reborn*

Congratulations all, and also congratulations and thank you to the projects the students will be working on!
