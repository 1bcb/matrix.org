The Matrix Jobs Room ([#jobs:matrix.org](https://matrix.to/#/#jobs:matrix.org)) 
is a public room where vendors can post jobs and potential customers can apply
to take them.

What follows is a basic guide to etiquette and how to get what you need from 
the room.

## For Customers

Post your request with as much context, transparency and information as 
possible. For example, if you have a specific installation requirement for a 
project, mentioning these details would be helpful in the initial post.

Once you've selected a vendor, post to the public room to say so, to save other 
vendors continuing to email you.

## For Vendors

If you have questions about the scope of the project, you can ask them in the 
public room before moving to Direct Messaging with the customer. This will 
allow other potential vendors to see more details of the request and save the 
customer needing to type the same details to multiple people.
