Starting in 2020, team Matrix planned to start running regular meetup events, 
with speakers, talks, Q+A, beer, pizza etc.

We hosted one, in London, in February. Around that time and immediately 
afterward, much of the world shut down due to a global pandemic, and hosting 
in-person meetups became infeasible.

Rather than drop the idea, we decided to make use of the technologies we 
regularly promote to host a *virtual* meetup event. The idea being to try to 
recreate the fun and atmosphere of a real meetup in a decentralised way.

## Use Jitsi forÂ Video

It's important to us, wherever possible, to use Open tools. Jitsi Meet is Open 
Source, self-hostable video conferencing platform.
[Installing Jitsi is a much-documented experience](https://github.com/jitsi/jitsi-meet/blob/master/doc/quick-install.md) that I won't delve into here, but for our purpose we used our 
installation at <https://jitsi.modular.im>.

First, we want to get our speakers all connected. To do this, we created a new 
room on Jitsi (the name doesn't matter), and made sure to add a password, since 
this is not the default. All the speakers for the session will connect to this 
room.

Next, we configured the Jitsi Meet server to stream to YouTube, and also made 
the stream available directly via a video control on https://stream.matrix.org.

Note that we did not make the call itself available for the entire audience to 
join - this would likely have been a impossible moderation task, and would not 
have added to the experience.

## Use Matrix for live chat

We created a dedicated "watching" matrix room, where users could join to talk 
to each other about the streamed presentations. They can also talk to each 
other more generally about the topics - or about anything else. We were pleased 
to see conversations flowing, since these "unofficial" exchanges are a big part 
of in-person meetups we wanted to recreate.

The other thing the viewers can do in the room is ask questions of the 
speakers. To do this, the host pulls questions out of the room, and collects 
them ready to ask the presenter. In our event, we waited until the end of the 
presentations, but a host could choose to interrupt the speaker to ask.

With a dedicated room created, it's possible to add a widget to the room 
containing only the video embed. To do this, make a page (like
<https://stream.matrix.org>) which contains ONLY the video, then create a
new custom widget in the matrix room in Riot.
