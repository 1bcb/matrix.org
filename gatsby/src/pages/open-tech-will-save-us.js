          Open Tech Will Save Us is a virtual meetup, taking the form of a
          monthly live video stream broadcasting on the second Wednesday of
          every month at 5pm UTC.

          Open, Interoperable standards, and how they can enable decentralised
          tech to keep our data private while still enabling communication.
